A pretty long time ago I moved this blog from Wordpress to the static website generator Hugo. But, I missed an important point: Without a Git system, this doesn't make sense - so no new posts since then. 

Is error is fixed: Now this page uses `blogdown`, an `R`-blogging package. The files are located on [Github](http://github.com/cutterkom/datablog) and is connected to [Netlify](http://netlify.com) to build the site.
