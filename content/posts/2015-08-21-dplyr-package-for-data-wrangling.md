The dplyr package seems to be the most popular package for data wrangling. It simplifies the weird R syntax and offers five distinct functions:

`filter`, `select`, `arrange`, `mutate`, `summarise`

More in a tutorial for starters: <a href="https://rpubs.com/justmarkham/dplyr-tutorial" target="_blank">Introduction to dplyr for Faster Data Manipulation in R</a>

Dplyr is developed &#8211; like ggplot2, the standard package for plotting &#8211; by <a href="https://github.com/hadley/" target="_blank">Hadley Wickham</a>. Wickham is a star in the R community. A star in like &#8220;people want to make selfies with him&#8221;-star, says Priceonomics in its post <a href="http://priceonomics.com/hadley-wickham-the-man-who-revolutionized-r/" target="_blank">The Man Who Revolutionized R</a>.
