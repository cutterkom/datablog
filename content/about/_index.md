My name is Katharina Brunner, I am working as a Data Journalist at the German newspaper [SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung](http://sz.de). 

My tasks involve the full range of data analysis, like, researching and gathering relevant data sources, getting and cleaning the data, extracting information by using statistical methods, visualizing the data and writing reports.

My programming language of choice is R (tidyverse), I consider myself as a member of the [#rstats community](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats).

This website serves as a notebook for data related links and code snippets.
